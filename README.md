# RAG-with-Open-Llama-and-Langchain
Retrieval Augmentation with Open-Llama and LangChain and also used PineCone Vector DB

Overview
This repository hosts the retrieval_augmentation_open_llama_langchain.ipynb Jupyter notebook. It is centered around demonstrating the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the open-source LLaMa model, integrated with LangChain and Pinecone's vector database. This notebook serves as an advanced guide for implementing retrieval augmentation in natural language processing tasks, showcasing the powerful synergy between these cutting-edge technologies.
